The Chaptastic Poker Bot is a Node.js Discord bot that allows users to poll their friends on the best time to host events. It mimics the popular web application Whenisgood's functionality, but compartmentalizes the entire experience in Discord. This allows for faster response times, lowers the liklihood of forgetting to respond, and provides the host and users with an up to date tally of what dates are popular.
